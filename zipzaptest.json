  "campaignNotes": "I went to prison for a small misunderstanding about the authenticity of a device I sold to a Vesk Associate Quartermaster (or high up position).\n\n Inside, I met a small group of union organizers serving their time, including Shan, who told me all about the injustices they had faced. \n\nMy \"underworld contacts\" are all union organizers from various corps. \n\n When we later met at Abadar Corp, Shan and I hit it off again becoming good friends. While I admired Shan and how hard they worked trying to organize the other workers, I did not want to return to prison and held back.\n\nMy deepest regret is not helping Shan more.",
